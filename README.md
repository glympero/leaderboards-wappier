# leaderboards-wappier

The goal is the development of an application that displays a list of leaderboard users along

with their score.

# Installation

Download from github and make sure to always open the Xcode workspace
instead of the project file when building your project as it contains
two cocopods. Alamofire and SwiftyJson.
